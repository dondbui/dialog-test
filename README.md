# dialog-test
This is my own experiment in parsing Yarn JSON files for conversation systems without going fully into the Yarn/Twine scripting language.

### Reasoning
- The Twine/Yarn dialog node graph editor is a great intuitive way to edit and create dialog.
- Though very powerful the scripting system that comes with YarnSpinner may be a bit excessive for my purposes.
- The JSON that is outputted by Yarn is very very clean which is a good thing.
- I want to create my own simpler dialog system fit for my own personal projects.
- I thought architecting my own dialog system would be fun.
